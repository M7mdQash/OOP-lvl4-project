Hello 
this project is for my second year in CS, its for object oriented proggraming
this project is a basic chess project I did to better understand object oriented proggraming principles 

I used a multipul of classes such as Board Piece and indivisual pieces classes 
I used inhritence for the pieces to give them functionallity (I made them inherent the piece class)
and used the board class to represent the chess board and actions on the board 

the main method and class that runs the game is in the game class
the second most important class is the Board class that represent moves on the board and the board itself
the third most important is the piece class that gives and enables pieces to have actions and properties 
lastly the other piece class come last, each piece has different moves so it will have differing code in their move methods.
