Hello 
this project is for my second year in CS, its for object oriented proggraming
this project is a basic chess project I did to better understand object oriented proggraming principles 

I used a multipul of classes such as Board Piece and indivisual pieces classes 
I used inhritence for the pieces to give them functionallity (I made them inherent the piece class)
and used the board class to represent the chess board and actions on the board
